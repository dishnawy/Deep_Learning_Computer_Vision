# Deep Learning Computer Vision
> A basic convolutional neural network, trained on images to detect the classes of an image. The code is built using Keras, and numpy

### To train the model:
```sh
python cnn.py
```

### To predit an image:
```sh
python predictor.py
```
make sure to modify the code to fit your needs.

## General comments:
* This is intended to be an example of using Keras for computer vision, and implementing CNN, an actual production model could include a larger training dataset, more layers, and be trained on a larger image sizes (ex. 128x128).

##Important Note
The code will need to be altered to use a GPU for the training, this is built to run on a CPU. 

## Release History
